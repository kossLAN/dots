# kossLAN's personal quickshell dots, for personal use.

The idea is to eventually be minimal but also use material 3 design language, low padding, low margin, and not distracting.

- [ ] Lockscreen (WIP)
- [ ] Port visuals to more material 3 aethestic (WIP) 
- [x] Make volume mixer 
- [x] Screenshot tool (WIP - kinda scuffed, but is functional)
- [ ] Recording/Clip widget with gpuscreenrecorder
- [x] Session Manager
- [ ] Battery Profile Popup
- [ ] REDO Volume OSD (WIP)
- [ ] REDO Launcher (wallpaper picker, calculator, commands, etc...)
- [ ] Music Player Popup V4 lol

### Optionals
